/**
 * The ink clipboard (roadmap: copy/paste ink + across notes).
 *
 * Module state, like the tool: one clipboard for the session, so a lasso
 * copied in one note pastes into any other. The STROKES never go on the
 * system clipboard - a paste of note-space coordinates has nothing honest
 * to say to another application (that's what the SVG export is for) - but
 * a one-line MARKER does, because ctrl+v has nothing else to go on. See
 * inkClipboardMarker below.
 *
 * Coordinates ride along unchanged: ink lives on a fixed grid, so a stroke
 * pasted into another note lands at the same place on that note's page.
 * Pasting back into the SOURCE note staggers by 16px per paste, or the copy
 * would sit invisibly on its original.
 *
 * Every paste mints fresh ids. The store skips ids it already holds
 * (applyAdd's duplicate guard), and undo tracks strokes by id, so a pasted
 * stroke must be a new individual, not a reference.

/**
 * The line ink copy leaves on the system clipboard.
 *
 * Without it ctrl+v had no way to know the last copy was ink: the strokes
 * sat in module state, the system clipboard still held whatever text was
 * there before, and pasting did that instead (reported 1.1.2 - the copy
 * notice appears, the paste does nothing). The marker is an identity
 * card, never the data: it names the ink this session holds, so a marker
 * left over from an earlier run is recognized and refused rather than
 * pasting whatever ink happens to be loaded now.
 *
 * Copying anything else replaces the marker, which is exactly the
 * disambiguation a private clipboard could not do: text copied after ink
 * pastes as text. A clipboard manager keeps the line in its history, so
 * pasting that entry again pastes the ink again.
