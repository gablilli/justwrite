/**
 * The standing gesture guard's STYLE half: what "armed" physically writes
 * to the editor's scroller (the decision half is ManipulationGuard, the
 * timers live in InlinePenRouter).
 *
 * Armed means two things, always together:
 *
 *   1. `touch-action: none` as an inline style on `.cm-scroller` itself,
 *      the v0.12.10 cold-contact fix. Chromium snapshots the allowed
 *      gestures from the committed compositor state at contact, so the
 *      opt-out must already be in place before a pen exists.
 *
 *   2. A marker class on the scroller that styles.css turns into
 *      `touch-action: none` on EVERY descendant. Blink re-enables panning
 *      inside every nested scroll container: an element whose own overflow
 *      is auto/scroll gets pan-x/pan-y OR'ed back into the touch-action it
 *      inherits (style_adjuster.cc, AdjustTouchActionForElement: "since
 *      panning is implemented by the scroller it is re-enabled for
 *      scrolling elements"), whether or not it has anything to scroll.
 *      Obsidian's editor has several such containers inside the scroller:
 *      the embedded backlinks pane (`.backlink-pane`, overflow-y: auto),
 *      table widgets, math blocks, callout content, embeds. Inside them
 *      the scroller's `none` was silently `pan-y`/`pan-x` again: a pen
 *      drag with a vertical component past slop became a scroll gesture,
 *      the stroke died with pointercancel, and the band across "Linked
 *      mentions / No backlinks found / Unlinked mentions" read as dead
 *      (hardware, 2026-08-22). No CSS selector can enumerate scroll
 *      containers by computed style, so the rule is universal under the
 *      class (inert for everything that already inherited none, closing
 *      exactly the holes), and the class moves in lock-step with the inline
 *      style so the touch window (native finger panning) still opens
 *      everywhere at once.
 *
 * DOM-free by construction so the pairing is unit-tested.
