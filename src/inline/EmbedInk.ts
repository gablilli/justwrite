/**
 * Ink in rendered markdown (roadmap: ink showing in embeds).
 *
 * The overlay only ever painted the live editor. Everywhere else a note's
 * markdown is RENDERED - an ![[embed]] of it, or its own reading view - the
 * page showed text and no ink. This paints the committed strokes there,
 * read-only, using the committed renderer.
 *
 * Anchoring is the fixed-grid doctrine applied honestly: strokes live at
 * note-space coordinates, so they draw at those coordinates from the
 * rendered content's top-left. A rendered page wraps its text differently
 * than the editor did (narrower embed, different padding), and the ink does
 * not chase the text - it never does.
 *
 * Mechanics: markdown post-processors run once per SECTION, and the section
 * element is not attached to the document yet when the processor runs. So
 * each section registers a MarkdownRenderChild; on load (now attached) it
 * walks up to the rendered document's root and attaches ONE ink layer
 * there, keyed by a data attribute so the other sections' children see it
 * and stand down.
 *
 * Staleness (1.0.5): ink saves touch the sidecar and never the .md, so a
 * rendered embed used to keep its picture until Obsidian happened to
 * re-render it. Now every attached root sits in a registry, and one
 * ink-changed notification per persisted gesture repaints the roots showing
 * that path. The marker attribute carries a per-path revision, so attach
 * stays idempotent when nothing changed and repaints when the revision
 * moved. Disconnected roots are swept on every notification; the registry
 * holds at most a screenful of embeds between gestures.

/**

 * This replaced a 2048px cap on each SIDE, which was the wrong shape for the
 * thing it was protecting against. A per-side cap does not bound cost - two
 * capped sides still buy 4.2M pixels - and it CLIPS: a note with ink below
 * 2048px lost it, in reading view and in anything printed from it. Ink
 * silently missing from a page is a worse failure than a heavy canvas.
 *
 * An area budget bounds the real cost (this is 16MB of RGBA) while letting a
 * tall narrow page be tall. When ink genuinely exceeds it, the layer degrades
 * in RESOLUTION rather than dropping strokes - every stroke still renders,
 * slightly softer. Hover previews and multi-embed notes each pay for their
 * own canvas, so this is a battery bound as much as a memory one.
