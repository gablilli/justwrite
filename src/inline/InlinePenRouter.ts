/**
 * Pen capture for the inline overlay.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT the canvas PointerRouter, although the pen path
 * mirrors it move for move. The difference is everything else: on the canvas,
 * Handwriting owns the whole surface, so touch pans the camera and mouse navigates.
 * On an ordinary note the EDITOR owns the surface. Touch must scroll and
 * place carets natively, the mouse must select text natively, and Handwriting may
 * claim exactly one thing: the pen.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   Pen tip      -> ink. Claimed in the CAPTURE phase on the editor's
 *                   scroller, before CodeMirror's own handlers (which live on
 *                   the child content element) can see it.
 *   Pen side    -> claimed: held at contact it lassos and moves ink.
 *   Pen eraser   -> claimed and swallowed (no ink, and no accidental
 *                   right-click storm from the eraser end).
 *   Touch        -> passed through untouched, UNLESS the palm gate says a pen
 *                   is active or hovering, in which case the contact is
 *                   swallowed before the editor can scroll or place a caret
 *                   under the writer's palm. This is the only touch handling,
 *                   and it is not on the pen hot path.
 *   Mouse        -> never touched.
 *
 * The pen hot path is byte-for-byte the frozen pipeline's shape: sync work
 * inside `pointerrawupdate`, coalesced samples, no allocation on move events
 * beyond the sample array.

// ---- gesture guard ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// The prime suspect for the cut-off strokes: the editor's scroller is a
// pannable region and does NOT carry `touch-action: none` (the canvas root
// did, and fingers must keep scrolling here, so it never can statically).
// For direct-manipulation pointers, `preventDefault` on pointerdown does not
// opt out of native panning. Only `touch-action` does. So once the pen drags
// past the browser's slop threshold, Chromium reclassifies the contact as a
// pan and fires `pointercancel`. Our end funnel then honestly commits a
// centimetres-long stroke.
//
// v0.12.10, STANDING GUARD (the cold-contact fix). The hover-reactive guard
// above was necessary but not sufficient: Chromium snapshots the allowed
// gestures from the COMMITTED compositor state at contact, so arming on hover
// only protects contacts whose approach hover got committed a frame earlier.
// A cold strike (no prior hover) reached pointerdown with panning still
// allowed, the pan won, and the first stroke scrolled instead of inking.
// Hardware-repeatable; hover-first was always fine. There is no reactive fix for
// a cold contact; the protection must already be committed. So the guard's
// RESTING state is now `touch-action: none`. Wheel/touchpad and mouse ignore
// touch-action entirely; palm-blocked touches never open the window.
//
// v0.12.12: the window opens on LIFT, not on touchStart. v0.12.10 restored
// touch-action the instant a non-palm-gated finger landed, and hardware
// showed the residual failure that bought: on a cold slam the hand's edge
// reaches the glass milliseconds before the pen tip, the palm gate cannot
// block it (no hover in its 300 ms window; cold means cold for the palm
// too), the window opened on that graze, and the tip then landed on a
// restored-pan snapshot and scrolled. Post-touchpad contacts are always cold
// (pen hover disables the touchpad, so the pen was necessarily away), which
// is why the failure tracked "immediately after touchpad scrolling"; the
// ~1 s recovery is the deliberate approach leading with hover. Now the whole
// first gesture runs under the standing none, carried end-to-end by the 1:1
// assist pan; the native window (subsequent gestures fully native, one-shot
// re-arm timer) opens only when the last finger lifts, and only if the
// gesture actually panned. A tap or resting palm never disarms the guard.
// A pen claim mid-gesture reclassifies the carried touch as palm.
//
// v0.13.6 RC3: the guard covers the scroller's SUBTREE too. Blink re-enables
// panning inside every nested scroll container (AdjustTouchActionForElement:
// an element whose own overflow is auto/scroll gets pan-x/pan-y OR'ed back
// into the touch-action it inherits, whether or not it has anything to
// scroll). Obsidian's editor has several: the embedded backlinks pane
// (`.backlink-pane`, overflow-y: auto), table widgets, math blocks, callout
// content, embeds. Inside them the standing `none` on `.cm-scroller`
// was silently `pan-y`/`pan-x` again: a pen drag with a vertical component
// past slop became a scroll gesture, the stroke died with pointercancel, and
// the whole band across "Linked mentions / No backlinks found / Unlinked
// mentions" read as dead (hardware, 2026-08-22). The style write is now
// GuardStyle.ts: inline none on the scroller plus a class that styles.css
// turns into none on every descendant, toggled together so the touch window
// still opens everywhere at once.

// the scroller, so mouse-compat / drag / selection machinery could still react
// to a claimed contact (the eraser visibly dragged the editor caret).
//
// The ownership guard is a set of WINDOW-capture listeners (window precedes
// document in the capture phase, so they pre-empt app-level handlers) that
// suppress mouse-like fallout while a claimed stroke is active and for a short
// tail after it ends (trailing click/auxclick/contextmenu land post-pointerup).
