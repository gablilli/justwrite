 * A selectable diagnostics report, with two ways off the device.
 *
 * v0.13.12 and earlier said "the report is selected, press Ctrl+C" and relied
 * on a programmatic `select()` over a read-only textarea. Both halves of that
 * assume a desktop: an iPad has no Ctrl key unless a keyboard case is
 * attached, and iOS doesn't reliably raise its Copy affordance for a selection
 * the page made instead of one the user made. If a remote tester runs every
 * gesture and then can't get the report off the device, the whole session was
 * wasted, so the report leaves by an explicit button now, and by a file in the
 * vault when the clipboard won't play.
