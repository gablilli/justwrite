/**
 * Very basic stroke smoothing, for the Raw vs Smoothed comparison.
 *
 * Method: midpoint-quadratic. Each pair of consecutive samples contributes a
 * quadratic curve that runs from the midpoint of the previous pair, through
 * the shared sample as its control point, to the midpoint of the current pair.
 * The polyline's corners become tangent-continuous curves, so the faceting you
 * get from drawing straight lines between samples disappears, without any
 * filter, averaging window, or lag term.
 *
 * A midpoint curve can only be drawn once the sample after it has arrived, so
 * smoothing on its own would leave the visible line half a sample behind the
 * nib. It does not, because rendering is split:
 *
 *   settled tail   every segment behind the newest sample, smoothed, final
 *   live head      a raw straight stub from the last midpoint to the newest
 *                  sample, redrawn on every event
 *
 * The drawn line therefore always reaches the pen exactly where the raw build
 * put it, while everything behind the nib is curved. At pen-up the head is
 * replaced by the closing curve and the whole stroke converges on the same
 * geometry the committed layer draws.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do: touch pressure, resample, simplify, or
 * alter stored samples. Canonical point data stays the real pen data;
 * smoothing is rendering geometry, not an input filter.
