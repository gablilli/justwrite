/**
 * Ribbon rendering: a stroke drawn as ONE filled variable-width outline
 * instead of a chain of separately stroked segments.
 *
 * Why this exists. Stroking each segment on its own paints a capsule per
 * segment, and the union of hundreds of antialiased capsules composites its
 * edge pixels over and over. Every overlap darkens and roughens the silhouette
 * a little, and each capsule's width is constant along its length, so a
 * pressure change puts a step in the outline. At zoom 1 with 2-pixel segments
 * none of that is visible. Magnify it six times and the edge reads as beaded
 * and stair-stepped, which is exactly the reported defect, and it is not a
 * raster resolution problem: it is what the geometry was asking the rasterizer
 * to draw.
 *
 * A ribbon is built once, filled once, antialiased once. Width varies
 * continuously along it because each side point carries its own half-width.
 *
 * The centerline is the same midpoint-quadratic curve as before, flattened at
 * a density chosen from the current zoom, so zooming in subdivides further
 * instead of revealing the flattening. Canonical stroke points are untouched;
 * this is rendering geometry only.
