/**
 * The wet ink layer: incremental screen-space drawing of the stroke that is
 * currently being written (handoff §7). The latency path is:
 *
 *   PointerEvent -> convert to world -> drawSegment -> return
 *
 * No full-page rerender, no rAF wait. Segments are painted synchronously in
 * the pointer handler for minimum perceived latency.
 *
 * v0.1.2: the `desynchronized` context attribute is a request, not a promise.
 * Chromium decides whether a canvas is eligible for the low-latency path based
 * on compositing state, which is not necessarily settled at getContext() time.
 * So we snapshot getContextAttributes() at three moments (creation, after the
 * first real draw, and on demand) instead of trusting a single early read.
