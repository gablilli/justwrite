/**
 * Ink shaping: the difference between a polyline that tracks the pen and a
 * line that looks like it was written. Three effects, all computed from the
 * stored samples (x, y, pressure, t) at render time, so the canonical stroke
 * data is untouched and wet and committed ink always agree:
 *
 *   pressure settling   raw digitizer pressure jitters sample to sample, and
 *                       mapping it straight to width puts that jitter on the
 *                       outline. A one-pole filter settles it.
 *
 *   velocity thinning   a real nib starves at speed: fast strokes come out
 *                       thinner than slow ones. This is most of what makes
 *                       handwriting read as handwriting; without it every
 *                       letter has the same dead weight everywhere.
 *
 *   endpoint taper      strokes start and end at a tip, not at a blunt round
 *                       cap. The taper runs over a short arc length at each
 *                       end. The wet layer can only taper the start (the end
 *                       is unknown until pen-up); the committed repaint at
 *                       hand-off adds the end taper, so the stroke visibly
 *                       "dries" into its final shape the way OneNote's does.
 *
 * The highlighter is exempt: a chisel tip does not taper or starve, and its
 * flat, even wash is the whole point of the tool.
