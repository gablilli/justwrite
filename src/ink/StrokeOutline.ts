/**
 * A stroke's filled geometry, once, for every exporter.
 *
 * `StrokeRenderer` draws to a canvas, `SvgExport` writes path data and
 * `InkPdf` writes content-stream operators, and all three must describe the
 * SAME shape or a note looks different depending on how it left the plugin.
 * The flatten and the ribbon offsets live here so that stays true by
 * construction rather than by three copies agreeing.
 *
 * The shape is an outline plus discs, and the discs are not decoration: the
 * outline self-intersects inside tight turns, and filling outline-plus-discs
 * under a NONZERO winding rule unions them into the pinch-free shape the
 * canvas renderer produces. Any consumer that fills these must use nonzero.
 *
 * Pure. Same reason ScrollBand and PinchScale are.
